# Password-Protected-Door-Lock
Password Based Door Lock System is designed by using ARDUINO UNO R3
 in which as soon as the appropriate code or password is entered, the door is
 opened and the person is permitted entry to the secured area or place. Old long
established lock structures use mechanical locking and those may be changed
 through new superior strategies of locking structures. These methods are a
 mixture of mechanical and digital devices and are distinctly clever. One of the
 awesome functions of these door lock structures is their simplicity and high effi
ciency. Such an automatic lock gadget is composed of digital manage assembly,
 which controls the output load via a password. The instance of this output load
 may be a motor or a an automatic door latch.
